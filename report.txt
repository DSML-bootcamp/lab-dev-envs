Report for Alexandre

### Process

Since the lab was unclear, i had the gatekeeper create a repo and invite me. I then forked it, cloned it and changed some files. 
I then pushed to my repo and started a pull request, which the gatekeeper accepted.

We did the same but with me as the gatekeeper, in reverse.

### Challenges faced and how to overcome them

Understanding who had to create the git repository since we cant pull request our own. The lab asks to git push -u origin main but this adds the code to the main branch, meaning the job of the gatekeeper becomes useless.
We overcame this by having the gatekeeper create the repo and the developer fork it.
