LAB DEV-ENVS REPORT

Developer role
- the steps up to initialize git was ok
- the only turnaround was when I had to push to 'main' branch as my repository was in the 'master' branch. To solve that I had to create a new branch by running the code:

''
$ git checkout -b main
$ git push u- origin main
''

- to be able to create a pull request I had to create a new branch called "new-feature-branch":

''
$ git add main.py
$ git commit -m 'new feature'
$ git push -u origin new-feature-branch
''

- last step was going to github and creating the pull request: https://github.com/linamps/projectx_dev/pull/1
